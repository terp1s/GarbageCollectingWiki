# Garbage Collection in Git

## Overview

This project provides an understanding of **Garbage Collection in Git**, explaining how Git manages and cleans up unnecessary objects within a repository. 

## What is Garbage in Git?

In Git, **garbage** refers to objects (like commits, blobs, or trees) that are no longer reachable from any branches, tags, or reflogs. These objects still exist in the repository but are effectively unused and can be safely removed.

## Purpose of the Project

The aim of this project is to:
- Explain how garbage is created in Git.
- Demonstrate the garbage collection process.
- Teach users how to manage garbage in their repositories.

## Key Concepts

- **Git Garbage Collection (GC)**: A process that removes unreachable objects to optimize the repository.
- **Unreachable Objects**: Objects that are no longer accessible from any references.
- **Reflog Expiration**: Refers to the expiration of entries that can lead to garbage.
