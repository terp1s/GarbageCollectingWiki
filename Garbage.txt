--GARBAGE--

In computer science, garbage represents memory, which is allocated for some use, although it is not used by any program. This leads to inefficient use of memory. Most programming languages automatically perform deallocation of this memory. This action is called garbage collection. The exception to this is for example C and C++, where the programmer has to take care of the memory themselves. There are two types of garbage:

SYNTACTIC GARBAGE

Syntactic garbage cannot be reached, as it is not referenced by anything. This type of garbage could be a result of deleting a head of a linked list, leaving the body without a pointer. This is alco called unreachable memory/object.


SEMANTIC GARBAGE

Semantic garbage is such part of code, that can be reached, but will not be.
